            <p class="p">A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the
                muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about
                80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the
                muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchenne
                smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be
                perceived as insincere.</p>
